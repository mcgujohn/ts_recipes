# MailChimp 7.x-3.x to 7.x-4.x Upgrade Process
--
### No Features module? No problem:
1. Update normally (.make), changing both the [module version](https://www.drupal.org/project/mailchimp) and the [library version](https://github.com/thinkshout/mailchimp-api-php/releases/download/v1.0.5/v1.0.5-package.zip).
2. Run a `drush updb`, and that should do the trick.

### Features module? You've got a little extra work:
1. Follow steps 1 & 2, listed above.
2. Login as an admin and head over to the MailChimp Signup form configurations page (path: `admin/config/services/mailchimp/signup`).
3. Click "edit" on each Signup form and hit "Save".
4. Recreate any Feature modules that have the MailChimp Signup forms attached to them - this will export the new signup form configurations and will keep the Features module from overriding the new configurations with the old ones.
