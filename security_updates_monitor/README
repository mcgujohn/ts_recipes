# Summary
This tool is meant to show which of our sites have security updates available.
It uses drush sa to get a list of sites and can filter on things like .live to only include live sites.

# TODO/Ideas
* Make output look nice
* Check all versions between current and new for security advisories (only the new version is checked now)
* Automatically email results
 * Recipients could be based on security risk level (if a critical update is present, email to x and y, otherwise just to x)
* See if we can make this work with Drupal 8 (composer) and Wordpress
