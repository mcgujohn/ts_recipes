#Terminus plugin install
Copy security-updates-terminus-plugin folder to ~/.terminus/plugins

# Summary
This tool is meant to show which of our sites have security updates available.

# TODO/Ideas
* enable/disable update module when it's not enabled (not sure if we want to do this on live sites)
* Make output look nice
* Automatically email results
 * Recipients could be based on security risk level (if a critical update is present, email to x and y, otherwise just to x)
* See if we can make this work with Drupal 8 (composer) and Wordpress
